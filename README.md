Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) is one of popular data mining technique with frequent pattern or itemset as representation of data. In other words, it is used to extract knowledge from a variety of datasets and applications. The main downsize of the process is that it is data and computing intensive. In fact, big data are the center of many realities now and growing exponentially: every day we create around 2.5 quintillion bytes. On the other hand, the chose algorithm must scan the dataset iteratively for many times to produce meaningful information. During the recent years, several efficient and scalable frequent itemset mining algorithms for big data analytics have been proposed by many researchers along with the rise of parallel and distributed computing to achieve higher efficiency. In this study, the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms are chosen to analyze the Old Newspaper dataset composed of 16,806,041 records. After filtering and pre-processing the dataset, the algorithms are implemented in the Apache Spark framework. In particular, FP-Growth is implemented using MLlib, the Spark scalable machine learning library with tools that make practical ML scalable and easy. Apriori is not supported directly by Spark, and thus computed “manually” through various steps. In conclusion, FP-Growth reached a solution within reasonable time, but Apriori revealed to be not efficient enough for iterative computation.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85356795/199339407-207717ac-2b15-4480-b3d5-c4c724d4f073.png)
